 -> Pixel object array
    Gonna do it while final optimization

 -> circular buffer
    i dont think its gonna be required here

 -> what is wstring (c++ thingy)
    i dont think its required at this point since no use of any string

 -> animate strings
    will do it while making multipke windows

 -> idea of a grammer , to parse and print accordingly (can be implimented in the global buffer)
    its not really required , will do impliment it in the game engine
     
 -> run multiple thread for different buffers
    need to do it asap , {buffer optimization comes before that}
